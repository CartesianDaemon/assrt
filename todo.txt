FLAWS

Test a wider variety of expressions, that the rsst! macro chooses a helpful set of subexpressions to display.
Test conditions with side-effects. Needs at least a warning, or to fix display to cope with them.

Confirm name for crate and macros before sharing any more widely.

FUNCTIONALITY

Add an optional assert message in place of the assert condition, as with assert!().

IMPROVEMENTS

Test out in tilegame.
Add wider and more persuasive examples.
Update README.
Add todo.txt to .gitignore, to track contents but not count as dirty.

Add tests that macro fails to compile when appropriate
Convert some examples to explicit doc examples/tests.

Share draft with people.
 Check how well the explanation works.
 Check what people use that fulfils this role better.

REFACTOR

Rewrite csst! as a macro_rules. Or remove it if it's redundant with rsst!.

BUGS

Test csst! with multiple comparison operators.
